The function `determines if all the boxes can be opened.` It takes a list `boxes` as input and performs the following steps:

1. Create a list `locked_boxes` of the same length as `boxes` and initialize all elements to `False`. This list keeps track of whether each box is locked or unlocked.

2. Set the first element of `locked_boxes` to `True` to represent that the first box is locked.

3. Iterate over each `box` in the `boxes` list.

4. For each `box`, iterate over its keys.

5. If the current `key` is equal to the index of the `box` in the `boxes` list and the corresponding `locked_boxes` element is `False`, set the `locked_boxes` element to `False`.

6. If the current `key` is within the valid range of indices of the `boxes` list, set the corresponding `locked_boxes` element to `True`.

7. If the current `key` is outside the valid range of indices, set the corresponding `locked_boxes` element to `False`.

8. Finally, return the result of the `all` function applied to the `locked_boxes` list, which will be `True` if all elements are `True`, indicating that all boxes can be opened.
